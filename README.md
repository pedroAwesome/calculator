# calculator

English Description, para a descrição em PT-BR refira-se aos comentários feitos no próprio código

simple calculator code i made, there's probably a much more efficient way of doing this, what with HTML and whatnot, but i am Not very good with that yet, so this is the result
for calculating factorials, use only 1 number instead of 2
for calculating percentages, the first number will be the designated percentage, and the second number is the base value.

input the operation you want to perform between the '' in function calculadora()

# translation:

adicao = sum

subtracao = subtraction

multiplicacao = multiplication

divisao = division

fatorial = factorial

porcentagem = percentage

(yes, this is much more inefficient when compared to an actual calculator, i just did this for practicing functions.
.....annnnd mostly because i was bored)
